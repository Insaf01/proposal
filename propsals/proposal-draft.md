# Decred Arabia Communications and Content Creation

## What?

This proposal is an effort by contributors from Arabic countries to increase the awareness, presence, and adoption of Decred in the Arabic region.

The objective of this proposal is to have a dedicated budget that will cover six months of operations that will include events and video creation.

## Why?

Knowing that the Arabic population is over [400 million](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_where_Arabic_is_an_official_language) people, spread across Asia and Africa, this proposal is for representing Decred in this area, so more people will get to know about it and use it.

Having seen the usefulness of the blockchain, many Arabic states have invested in the creation of specialized departments or have simply signed partnerships with world leaders in the sector. Many startup companies have appeared, creating an ecosystem conducive to the emergence of this technology in the Arabic world.

## How?

Since 2017 we've started our Decred adventure with love and we will continue to do what we have been doing.

After our work with Decred, we realized that it is very important to create links between Decred ecosystem and the wider users. And that's what we have been doing since 2018 till now, and we can see clearly that more people are interested and can understand the technology behind it and are changing their perception about it.

**Creating Arabic content:**

* Creating educational videos about Decred technology and how it works to help Arabic people understand it.
* Videos that were made so far: [History of Money](https://youtu.be/OFONdBbYbBc), [Decred Roadmap](https://youtu.be/_7Ae_Klwqo0), [Decred's Hybrid System](https://youtu.be/k6xXL_ttSDI).

**Networking with key players in the region, searching for talents, organizing, and participating in events:**

* [The Digital Economy and Blockchain Technology](https://www.facebook.com/events/241045786567334/). This was the first Decred meetup that we held in Casablanca in October 2018. People who attended were mostly cryptocurrency users. The talk was about Decred Project and blockchain technology and how they work.

* [IEEE Morocco Blockchain Summit](http://blockchainsummit.ma/). This was the first Blockchain Summit held in Morocco. We had a booth for 2 days during which we had the opportunity to meet people from different backgrounds (businessmen, professors, minister, students), most of them never heard of Decred, explain to them Decred technology and get them interested. The organizers asked us to talk about Decred governance and tech at their next event.

* [Decred, Success Story and Innovation](https://github.com/decredcommunity/events/blob/master/reports/20190921-decred-meetup-casablanca-morocco.md). In this event, we had the opportunity to talk about the experience of working as a Decred contractor. 30+ people attended, we had more contacts and opportunities after this event.

* [Event](https://github.com/decredcommunity/events/blob/master/reports/20191020-wafaa-casablanca-morocco.md) with Wafaa Association in Casablanca. After the "Decred, Success Story and Innovation", we were invited to talk in more detail about Decred and blockchain technology at Wafaa Association to computer science students.

* [Africa Blockchain Summit 2019](https://github.com/decredcommunity/events/blob/master/reports/20191121-africa-blockchain-summit-rabat-morocco.md) in Morocco. We were invited to attend the summit as Decred representatives. We had the opportunity to meet the main players in Morocco and Africa, and to talk about Decred with some of them.

* [Blockchain Technology and Use Cases](https://github.com/decredcommunity/events/blob/master/reports/20200124-blockchain-technology-and-use-cases-casablanca-morocco.md) in Casablanca, Morocco. We were invited by another association in Casablanca-Morocco "Toratiyat al Baidaa" to hold a workshop about blockchain technology and how it works. The attendees were mostly students (~50) who have heard about crypto, we got lots of questions and had to extend the event by 1 hour.

* [International Women's Day](https://www.meetup.com/fr-FR/GDGCasablanca/events/268661463/). In this day we had the opportunity to collaborate with Women Techmakers Casablanca. The event was held at ENSAM, a University of Science. Most of the 70 attendees were data science students and developers who asked more technical questions. We gave a talk about blockchain technology and a presentation how a transaction works on Decred's blockchain. ([photos](https://www.flickr.com/photos/187387360@N04/albums/72157713440754483))

* [The virtual training academy](https://github.com/decredcommunity/events/blob/master/reports/20200708-virtual-training-academy-internet.md) themed "youth entrepreneurship". This was the first online event that we've held during Covid-19 epidemy. The presentation was about blockchain technology and how Decred's hybrid PoW/PoS works.

* [Partnership agreement with OMJD](https://decredcommunity.github.io/events/index/20201128.1). After the online meetup with "The Moroccan Organization of Young Decision Makers" that was held online on 08 July 2020, we've signed a 2-year partnership agreement with OMJD in order to work together in the technological field for the benefit of the youth where we will present Decred and blockchain technology. There was a [press conference](https://youtu.be/2gI_RRdIJ5U) held at the end of the event.

Collectively these events made people and companies from different backgrounds hear about Decred, and allowed us to onboard new users and establish connections that may help in the future.

**Marketing Decred on social media:**

* Twitter [@DecredArabia](https://twitter.com/DecredArabia)
* Telegram: [@decredarabia](https://t.me/decredarabia)
* Facebook: [DecredArabia](https://www.facebook.com/DecredArabia)

## Work included in this proposal

* Creation of educational videos in Arabic in order to explain Decred and its features to a wider audience.

* Events and workshops about Decred technology and blockchain in order to meet people in real life, explain to them this great technology and make them fall in love with it and use it, and increase our network.

This proposal budget will cover all marketing materials, travel expenses and sponsorship/event organization as well as working hours.

## Who?

This proposal will be executed by Decred in Arabia Ops team: [arij](https://twitter.com/in_insaf) (Decred Arabia, Community Manager), and [Zakaria](https://twitter.com/aithzakaria1) (Design).

## Cost

Spending too much on videos at this point is not reasonable, so we've decided to record 3 strategic videos for now and use them as entry points we send to new people. If that works well we might add more videos in the next proposal.

[One](https://youtu.be/k6xXL_ttSDI) of the planned strategic videos has already been published and is included in this proposal's budget.
