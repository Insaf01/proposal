# Decred Arabia Communications and Content Creation Proposal

## What?

This proposal is an effort by contributors from Arabic countries to increase the awareness, presence, and adoption of the Decred Project in the Arabic region.

The objective of this proposal is to have a dedicated budget that will cover six months of operations that will include events and video creation.

## Why?

Knowing that the Arabic population is over 300 million people, spread across Asia and Africa, this proposal is to set a precedent for funding for a specific region of the world, so that Decred will be known all over the world.

Having seen the usefulness of the blockchain, many Arabic states have invested in the creation of specialized departments or have simply signed partnerships with world leaders in the sector. Many companies (start-ups) have also been created, creating an ecosystem conducive to the emergence of this technology in the Arabic world.

## How?

Since 2017 we've started our adventure with Decred with love and we will continue to do what we have been doing.

After our work with Decred, we realize that is very important to create links between Decred ecosystem and the wider users, and that's what we have been doing since 2018 till now, and we can see clearly that more people are interested and can understand the technology behind it and are changing their perception about it.

**Creating Arabic content:**

* Creating educative videos about Decred technology and how it works, so more Arabic people can understand it and know more about it, while watching these videos.
* Videos that were made so far: [History of Money](https://youtu.be/OFONdBbYbBc), [Decred Roadmap](https://youtu.be/_7Ae_Klwqo0), [Decred's Hybrid System](https://youtu.be/k6xXL_ttSDI).

**Networking with key players in the region, searching for talents, organizing, and participating in events:**

* [Decred Meet-Up](https://www.facebook.com/events/241045786567334/) "The Digital Economy and Blockchain Technology" ([photos](https://twitter.com/in_insaf/status/1056252398476423168), [photos](https://www.facebook.com/permalink.php?story_fbid=1884165438286394&id=1836611206375151)): This was the first Decred meet-up that we've held. People who attended were mostly cryptocurrency users. We talked about Decred Project and how it works and what is Blockchain Technology and how that Cryptocurrency and Blockchain are not Bitcoin. Although there weren't a lot of attendees, people were interested and were glad to attend an event about Blockchain and Crypto.

* [IEEE Morocco Blockchain Summit](http://blockchainsummit.ma/) (photos: [1](https://twitter.com/DecredArabia/status/1121011670808240128) [2](https://twitter.com/DecredArabia/status/1121160292333965313) [3](https://twitter.com/DecredArabia/status/1121695331253673984)): This was the first Blockchain Summit held in Morocco, there were speakers from all over the world, we've had a booth for 2 days during which we had the opportunity to meet people from different backgrounds (Businessmen, Professors, minister, students), most of them never heard of Decred, so it was an opportunity to explain it to them and get them interested, we've also distributed flyers and booklets of Decred, and we were asked by the organizers to have a speaking slot to explain more about Decred Governance and its tech in the next event that they will be held.

* [Decred, Success Story and Innovation Event](https://github.com/decredcommunity/events/blob/master/reports/20190921-decred-meetup-casablanca-morocco.md): In this event, we've had the opportunity to talk about the experience of working as a Decred Contractor. More people have attended, the event room was full, and we've had more contact and opportunities after this event.

* [Event](https://github.com/decredcommunity/events/blob/master/reports/20191020-wafaa-casablanca-morocco.md) with Wafaa Association in Casablanca: After the "Decred, Success Story and Innovation", we've been invited to talk in more detail about Decred and Blockchain technology at Wafaa Association to computer science students.

* [Africa Blockchain Summit 2019, Morocco](https://github.com/decredcommunity/events/blob/master/reports/20191121-africa-blockchain-summit-rabat-morocco.md): We've been invited to attend the Africa Blockchain Summit as Decred Group representative, we've had the opportunity to meet the main role players in Morocco and Africa, and to talk about Decred with some of them.

* [Blockchain Technology and Use Cases in Casablanca, Morocco](https://github.com/decredcommunity/events/blob/master/reports/20200124-blockchain-technology-and-use-cases-casablanca-morocco.md): We were invited by another association in Casablanca-Morocco `Toratiyat al Baidaa` to held a workshop about Blockchain technology and how it works. There were a lot of questions about blockchain and our work with Decred. The attendees were mostly students who didn't know about blockchain but knew about Bitcoin, cryptocurrencies, and mining.

* [International Women's Day](https://www.meetup.com/fr-FR/GDGCasablanca/events/268661463/): [photos](https://www.flickr.com/photos/187387360@N04/albums/72157713440754483): On International Women's Day, we've had the opportunity to collaborate with Women Techmakers Casablanca. The event was held at ENSAM, a University of Science. Most of the 70 attendees were data science students and developers. We gave a talk about Blockchain Technology and gave a presentation them how a transaction works on Decred's Blockchain. From this experience, we realized that people are more interested when they see how things work, and as most of the attendees were devs and data scientists we've had more technical questions.

* [The virtual training academy](https://github.com/decredcommunity/events/blob/master/reports/20200708-virtual-training-academy-internet.md) under the theme "youth entrepreneurship": This was the first online event that we've held during Covid-19 epidemy. We've started with an introduction about why do we need blockchain technology, followed by a definition of blockchain, how it works, its history, hash functions, public vs private keys, consensus mechanism where I explained different types of consensus mechanisms and how Decred's hybrid PoW/PoS System work, different types of blockchains and at the end we gave some blockchain use cases in different fields. It was a great experience, helding an event online, although we prefer presencial events, where we can interact directly with people.

* [Partnership](https://decredcommunity.github.io/events/index/20201128.1) agreement with OMJD: After the online meetup with "The Moroccan Organization of Young Decision Makers" that was held online on 08 July 2020, we've signed a partnership agreement with OMJD in order to work together in the technological field for the benefit of the youth. The partnership agreement details that we will hold meetups, workshops and conferences about Decred and Blockchain technology for the benefit of the young. The partnership agreement will go for two years. There was a [press conference](https://youtu.be/2gI_RRdIJ5U) held at the end of the event. The presentation took one hour, plus half an hour of Q&A.

Collectively these events made people and companies from different backgrounds hear about Decred, onboard new users and establish connections may help in the future.

## The work that will be involved in this proposal

* Creation of educational videos in arabic in order to explain decred how it works and its features to wider audience.
* Events and workshops about Decred technology and blockchain in order to meet people in real life, explain to them this great technology and make them fall in love with it and use it, and increase our network.

This proposal budget will cover all marketing materials, travel expenses and sponsorship/event organization as well as working hours.

## Who?

This proposal will be executed by Decred in Arabia Ops team: [arij](https://twitter.com/in_insaf) (Decred Arabia, Community Manager), and [Zakaria](https://twitter.com/aithzakaria1) (Design).

## Cost

In this table we will give a summary of all the cost and working hours that we will include in this proposal.

For videos, knowing that spending too much on videos at this point is not reasonable, we've decided to record 3 strategic videos for now and use them as entry points we send to new people. If that works good we might add more videos in the next proposal.
